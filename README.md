# Maximizing_RT_Classifier_in_QuPath_Endocrine_Cell_Focus

This project sought to build upon past comparison of AI algorithms for pancreatic cell classification in order to create a standardized imaging pipeline. We focused on maximizing the accuracy of a specific AI model, the Random Tree (RT) classifier. To do this, we trained/tested the model in QuPath using varying dataset sizes and datasets with combinations of samples. The project includes both custom Java scripts and model files that were run in or in conjuction with QuPath.
